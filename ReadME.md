# <center> Covid-19 in South Korea (2020) EDA <center><br>
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 data, aiming to derive meaningful insights from various aspects of the pandemic. The analysis encompasses diverse dimensions such as mortality rates, age and gender-based susceptibility, infection trends, and the impact of public awareness.<br>
## <center> Overview <center>

**Used dataset:**<br>

For this analysis we are using **[NeurIPS 2020] Data Science for COVID-19 (DS4C)** dataset  that can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset).<br>

**Mortality Rates and Recovery Trends:**<br>

The examination of mortality rates reveals a relatively low overall fatality rate among COVID-19 patients. Additionally, the analysis demonstrates a noteworthy convergence of confirmed and released cases over time, suggesting an evolving recovery pattern.<br>

**Age and Gender Susceptibility:**<br>

The data underscores that while younger individuals represent a majority of confirmed cases, their mortality rate remains significantly low. Conversely, older demographics face a heightened risk of mortality post-infection, with individuals in their 80s facing nearly a 25% chance of fatality.<br>

**Public Awareness:**<br>

Search trends related to COVID-19 indicate a substantial surge in online queries concurrent with the infectious wave, reflecting heightened public awareness and concern during the pandemic's peak periods.<br>

**Regional Outbreak Analysis:**<br>

An in-depth examination of the Daegu province reveals an alarming surge in infectious cases, emphasizing the urgency of investigating the root cause. The analysis attributes the outbreak primarily to public gatherings at the Shincheonji Church, highlighting the virus's heightened transmission risk in crowded settings.<br>

**National Scale Trends:**<br>

The analysis extends to a national scale, illustrating a consistent trend mirroring the Daegu outbreak. Notably, frontline workers face a significant risk, with approximately a 12% chance of contracting the virus. Moreover, overseas inflows contribute significantly to total infections, necessitating stringent surveillance and travel restrictions.
